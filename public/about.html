<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a third-year university student with a strong interest in web development. 
  I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly websites and exploring the latest technologies in front-end and back-end development.
   I’ve worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, and I’m currently learning more about server-side development and APIs. 
   I'm passionate about creating clean, efficient code and continuously improving my skills through personal projects and collaboration.
